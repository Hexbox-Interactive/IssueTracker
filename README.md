# IssueTracker

Welcome to our GitHub Issue Tracker! This repository is designed to streamline the process of reporting bugs, requesting new features, and flagging security vulnerabilities for our projects. Below, you'll find a brief guide on how to use this tracker effectively.

### How to Use:
1. **Bug Reporting:** If you encounter a bug while using our software, please create a new issue detailing the problem you've encountered. Be sure to include:
   - A clear and concise title describing the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the bug.
   - Expected behavior.
   - Any relevant screenshots or error messages.

2. **Feature Requests:** Have a great idea for a new feature? Submit a feature request! Explain the feature you'd like to see added to the project and why it would be beneficial.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Security is paramount. If you discover a security vulnerability in our software, please report it immediately. We take security concerns seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our project secure.

### Bug Lifecycle:
When a bug is reported, it goes through several stages before resolution:

1. **Bug Reported:** The initial stage where the bug is documented and reported by a user.

2. **Bug Verified:** Our triage team reviews the bug report, verifies its authenticity, and confirms that it can be replicated.

### Resolutions:
- **Bug Fixed:** Once the bug is confirmed, our development team works to fix it internally. The fix will be included in the next release of the software.
- **Bug Rejected:** In some cases, the reported issue may not be a bug or may not align with the project's goals. In such instances, the bug is marked as rejected.
- **Bug Won't Fix:** There are scenarios where the reported issue is acknowledged as a bug but won't be addressed due to various reasons such as technical limitations, low priority, or conflicts with project direction.

### Feature Request Lifecycle:
When a feature is requested, it undergoes the following stages:

1. **Feature Requested:** The initial stage where a user proposes a new feature for the project.

2. **Feature Accepted:** The proposed feature is reviewed by our team, and if it aligns with the project's goals, it is accepted for potential implementation in the future.

### Resolutions:
- **Feature Rejected:** Some feature requests may not fit the project's scope or may not be feasible. In such cases, the feature request is marked as rejected.
- **Feature Implemented:** When a feature request is approved and implemented by our development team, it will be included in the next release of the software.

### Contribution Guidelines:
- Feel free to contribute to discussions on existing issues.
- Respect others' opinions and remain courteous in all interactions.
- Ensure that any contributions align with our project's guidelines and coding standards.
